Pipes
-----

cat file | less
cat ./* | wc -l | tee word_count.txt | seq
seq $(cat ./* | wc -l | tee word_count.txt)


Problem solving
---------------
1. Create a command that cds into the last updated directory.
2. Output a sorted list of the files larger than 1M in the present directory
   and subdirectories. Check the Watty repo with it.
3. Count the number of lines in the whole Watty repo


Filesystem
----------

/boot
-----
The /boot directory contains all the files that are needed for the boot process.

/etc
----
Contains all system related configuration files.

/sbin
-----
Contains executable programs. Mostly administrative tools. Compared to the
files in /bin, the files in /sbin are normally only used by the root user.

/bin
----
Contains binaries for commonly used programs such as cat, cp, etc.
Also usually contains the shells like bash and csh. Compared to /usr/bin
the commands in /bin are the ones that are considered to be essensial.

/usr
----
Contains system-wide read-only files. All user installed programs and libraries
goes into here.

/var
----
Contains files that vary over time, such as logs, cached files, temporary files
and lock files.

/dev
----
Contains device and special files. These are interfaces for device drivers,
but do not need to correspond to actual physical devices (an example of this
is /dev/null, which is considered to be a pseudo-device).

/home
-----
Contains the users home directories. Here users can store various files. A user
stores his personal configuration files (dot-files) here.
